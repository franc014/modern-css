# Modern CSS techniques

This is just a repo that has a few demos that showcases some of the modern
CSS techniques that will help us create better UIs, for example Container Queries, :has, :is, and many more.
Check it out! It's under the Astro Build framework which is really awesome. You can find the CSS in each page component.
